### Overview

SwiftUI provides **views**, **controls** and **layout structures** for declaraing your app's user interface. The framework provides **event handlers** for delivering taps,**gestures** and other types of input to your app, and tools to manage the flow of data from your app's models down to the views and **controls** that users will see and interact with.

Define the app structure using the **App protocol**, and populate it with scenes that contain the views that make up your app's user interface.

Create your own custom views that conform to the **View protocol** , and compose them with **SwiftUI Views** for displaying **text**, **imagess**, and custom **shapes** using stack,list and more.

> You can integrate SwiftUI views with objects from *UIKit* , *AppKit* and *WatchKit* frameworks to take further advantage of platform-specific functionality.

> You can also customize **accessibility** support in SwiftUI, and **localize** your app's user interface for different languages,countries and cultural regions.

### Swift UI Navigation

You add navigation capabilities to a view by emebedding it in a NavigationView, and then nesting each row in a **NavigationView**,
and then nesting navigation view in a **NavigationLink** to set up a transition to a destination view.
